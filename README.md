# scorsero-client-proto
Prototyping client for alpha testing purposes. No beautiful structure, no clean code. Used as a testing point before writing real native applications.

## Announcement of termination
Due to ability to use Flowable BPMN engine and make close integration with Toggl, Todoist etc with custom Tasks or Task handlers, Scorsero is considered obsolete. There will be no more features, improvements or fixes.
